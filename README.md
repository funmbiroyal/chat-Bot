Project Overview
In this project, we aim to create a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-driven education platform that envisions a future 
where AI assumes the role of teachers. The platform will leverage artificial intelligence technologies to provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences 
to students. The prototype will demonstrate key features and functionalities of the envisioned platform.

Target Audience:
The AI-driven education platform prototype is designed for students of all ages, ranging from primary school to higher education. 
The platform will cater to a wide range of subjects and disciplines, making it suitable for a diverse student population.

Key Features and Functionalities:
User Registration and Authentication:
Users can create accounts and authenticate themselves to access the platform.
User roles can be defined, such as students, teachers, and administrators.
Upon a Successful user registration the user will receive a welcome email that tells that the account is activated
via the mail that was provided at the point of registration

Personalized Learning Paths:
Every registered user after logging in can access the platform and they will be taken to their dashboard where learning takes place.
Here, the user can start his learning by asking questions.

Technology Stack:
The AI-driven education platform prototype is built using the following technologies:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Back-end: Java, Springboot
Database: MySql
AI and Machine Learning: ChatGpt
Docker: For Creating Image Containers
Cloud Services: Railway(For Deloyment)
